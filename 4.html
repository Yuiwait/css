    <p>This is a tale of guts, grit, and glory in the life of a young man who faced a world that seemed like a Goliath compared to his own David-like struggles. A story of a boy who defied the lines on his hand to achieve what no one thought possible: to choose sport over a gun, peace over violence and life over death.</p>
