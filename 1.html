    <h2>About the movie</h2>
<p>Thamma is a supernatural horror-comedy centring on Alok, a television reporter whose life is saved by a mysterious woman named Tadaka following a bear attack. Their burgeoning relationship is immediately complicated by supernatural forces and ancient myths, as Alok discovers Tadaka belongs to a mystical, bloodline-driven tribe led by the formidable Yakshasan. Their forbidden romance quickly escalates into a conflict against supernatural reckoning and powerful family ties.</p>
